# Domain Analysis Toolkit

The Domain Analysis Toolkit (dat) is a python3 package that provides
tools taking a domain name as input, and returns addtional information
on that domain. It can be an analysis of the domain itself, looked up
from data-bases, retrieved from other services, or some combination
thereof.

The purpose of dat is to provide a reusable library of domain
name-related analysis, lookups, and retrieval functions, that are
shared within the Network Security research group at Aalborg
University, and also availble to the public for reuse and modification.
